# TrafficSimulation
Hi Guys! looking to Share a Project I made a while ago,This project showcases an agent-based simulation designed to explore how autonomous vehicles impact traffic efficiency. In this simulation, vehicles act as autonomous agents navigating a circular road, adhering to local rules for acceleration, braking, and maintaining following distances.
